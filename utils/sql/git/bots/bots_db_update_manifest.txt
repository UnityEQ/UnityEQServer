# Upgrade conditions:
# 	This won't be needed after this system is implemented, but it is used database that are not
#	yet using the versioning system to figure out where the database is schema wise to determine
#	which updates are necessary to run
#
# Example: Version|Filename.sql|Query_to_Check_Condition_For_Needed_Update|match type|text to match
#	0 = Database Version
#	1 = Filename.sql
#	2 = Query_to_Check_Condition_For_Needed_Update
#	3 = Match Type - If condition from match type to Value 4 is true, update will flag for needing to be ran
#		contains = If query results contains text from 4th value
#		match = If query results matches text from 4th value
#		missing = If query result is missing text from 4th value
#		empty = If the query results in no results
#		not_empty = If the query is not empty
#	4 = Text to match
