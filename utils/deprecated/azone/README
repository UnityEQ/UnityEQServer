Father Nitwit's Zone file converter

purpose: convert 23d files into .map files for LOS

If there are any 3d math folks reading this who know how to figure out
if a 3d triangle passes through a 3d, infinitely tall box (bounded x,y),
please let me know. The code in the converter dosent work right now, and
has been 'commented' out with the return on line 717 of azone.cpp


This does not work on windows, if you get it working, please let me know how.
You need to use a unix box to convert your map files, then the .maps should work
on your windows server.

how to use it:
built it with make
upload your s3d files into a directory.
	You do not need the _obj or _chr files, just the zone.s3d files.
copy the azone binary to that directory.
run it on each map file:
example: converting gfaydark
	./azone gfaydark
	this will read gfaydark.s3d and produce gfaydark.map
put these map files into Maps/ in your eqemu running directory.
